# java-flow-experiments
In this repository, I'm experimenting with [Reactive Streams](http://www.reactive-streams.org), which are going to become part of the Java 9 in the `java.util.concurrent` package in Java 8 application and with [native Java 9 Reactive Streams](http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html) as well.

This repository is prepared for my talk titled **Get ready for java.util.concurrent.Flow!** 

during [JDD](http://jdd.org.pl) 2017 Conference on 03.10.2017 in Krak√≥w, Poland.

Java 8 project
--------------

Inside `java8` directory, I'm playing with two implementations of Reactive Streams:
- [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)
- [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) (it's going to be included in Spring 5)
- [Akka Stream](https://github.com/akka/akka/tree/master/akka-stream)

Project inside `java8` directory can be cleaned, compiled and run via Gradle Wrapper.

It contains only exploratory tests for different reactive libraries.

Java 9 project
--------------

Inside `java9` directory I'm playing with native Java 9 Reactive Streams interfaces. This project is based on Gradle. If you have problems with importing it into IntelliJ IDEA, choose Java 8 during import and switch Java version to 9 after import. In the case of problems with compilation, update `gradle.properties` file. 

### Known issues

There may be problems with executing unit tests with Java 9 and Gradle from CLI.

Git branches
------------
- `master` branch contains code snippets from presentation and exepriments
- `presentation` branch contains code snippets for Java 8 shown during the presentation and empty project in Java 9 for live coding
